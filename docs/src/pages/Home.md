Welcome to **React Custom Spinner**, a lightweight and easy-to-use library of customizable React loader and spinner components. This package offers a diverse set of visually appealing, CSS-only loaders designed to fit seamlessly into any modern React application. Whether you're building dashboards, e-commerce platforms, or data-driven applications, our loaders will enhance your UI by providing smooth and intuitive loading feedback.

## Why Use React Custom Spinner?

Providing a good user experience is critical, especially during content loading or background processing. Users expect visual cues that something is happening behind the scenes, and loaders are the perfect way to communicate this. Using the `React Custom Spinner` package allows you to:

- 🎨 Customize colors, sizes, and speeds of animations.
- ⚡ Use lightweight, CSS-only animations without extra dependencies.
- 📦 Integrate easily with any React (or Next.js, Vite) application.
- 🧩 Choose from 20+ unique loaders covering a variety of use cases.

## Core Features:

### 💡 Simple and Declarative API

Our spinners follow the modern React declarative approach, meaning you can easily manage the loader state using props like _loading_, _color_, and _size_.

### 🌐 Zero Dependencies (besides React)

All loaders are built using pure CSS and React, ensuring fast rendering and no unnecessary dependencies that bloat your project size.

### 🎨 Fully Customizable

Control every aspect of the loader: colors, sizes, animation speed, and more.

### 🚀 Fast Performance

We leverage hardware-accelerated CSS animations, resulting in smooth transitions and minimal resource usage.
